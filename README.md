## JANE LIANG - FULL-STACK WEB DEVELOPER 


ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jane Liang, Welcome to my portfolio showcasing my experience in full-stack web development.


As a full-stack developer, I have a deep understanding of both the front-end and back-end aspects of web development and am able to build complete web applications from start to finish.


My expertise lies in utilizing modern technologies and frameworks such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Next.js, ASP.NET, Node.js, and MySQL to create engaging and user-friendly web experiences. I am also well-versed in database design and optimization, ensuring that my applications are fast, secure, and scalable.


Iâ€™m currently learning PHP to build dynamic web pages and improve my web development skills. I am also learning how to import data into a database using JavaScript and MySQL for efficient data management.
